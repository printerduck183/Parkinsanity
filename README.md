# Parkinsanity

Thank you for taking the time to read me.

This project is a casual 2D game in cartoon pixel art style. In the game, the player needs to control a car and park it correctly in different city scenarios within the time allotted. The player must not only master their own car control, but also stay alert to unexpected incidents â€” like those crazy drivers who care about nobody else. The project is acceptable for all ages. 

This game was developed using GameMaker. However, due to a bug in the current official release of GameMaker (version 2024.13.1.242), UI display errors may occur. Therefore, the GameMaker Beta version (version 2024.1400.0.896) is required for proper execution.
